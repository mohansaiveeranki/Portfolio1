  "about": "I am Hasmitha Krishna, a Master’s student in Computer Science at the State University of New York at Buffalo, specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. My research spans AI, Deep Learning, Computer Vision, Reinforcement Learning, and Natural Language Processing, with publications in IEEE and Springer venues. Some of my notable works include developing quantum kernel-aided SVM classifiers for speech classification, CNN and transformer-based models for Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia stage detection, sarcasm detection in low-resource languages like Telugu and Tamil, and deep reinforcement learning approaches for biomedical image analysis. I also gained hands-on industry experience during my internship at the National Remote Sensing Centre, ISRO, where I applied self-supervised learning on Sentinel-2 imagery for forest fire-affected area estimation. Beyond my technical expertise, I have actively contributed to event organization and leadership through my work with the AYUDH Foundation India, strengthening my teamwork and coordination skills. I am passionate about applying my background in AI and software development to industry challenges, and I am actively pursuing roles in Software and AI engineering.",
